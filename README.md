# CFMS on Websocket

CFMS (Confidential File Management System), is a complete solution for 
managing confidential documents. This is the repository used to 
implement server functionality.

The Project is still in the early stages of development and cannot 
guarantee the security and stability of running the Service. 

Welcome to Github Issues for improvements and bug reports.

You can access the Chinese Simplified version of the development 
documentation here: [CFMS Server Documentation][doc-url] 
However, Since this document was written specifically for the previous 
version of CFMS, much of it may be outdated. If possible, use code 
comments as the primary reference.
